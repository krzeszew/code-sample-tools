# What are the questions you shoud ask before creating new code sample

This document is devided into three main parts related to three different areas related to new code sample creation:

1. Audience
2. Value proposition
3. Practical aspects of implementation

Each area is really important in the process of creating samples of code that are relevant and meaningful.

## Audience: 

1. Who is the intended audience? 
    * level like beginner, intermediate, expert 
    * consider Specific roles like frontend, backend, data scientist 

2. What level of prior knowledge does the audience have? 
    * Avoid assumptions about existing knowledge.

3. How will the audience use this sample? 
    * copy-paste, 
    * adapt, 
    * learn from, 
    * integrate into a larger project 

## Code sample value proposition: 

1. What problem does this code sample solve? Does this sample address a common question that is frequently asked by developers?  
    * Is it a common pain point? 
    * a specific feature? 
    * a complex concept? 
    
2. What is the core value proposition of this sample?
    * Clarity, 
    * efficiency, 
    * best practices, 
    * demonstrating a specific technique
    * other? 

3. Does the sample highlight any performance optimizations or efficiency gains?  

4. Does this sample demonstrate how to use a specific feature or API effectively? 

5. What are the learning objectives? What specific skills or knowledge will the learner gain from this sample? 
    * What should the audience be able to do or understand after studying the sample?
    * Be precise, e.g., "learn to implement asynchronous API calls" vs. "learn about APIs."
    * Does this sample showcase the power and capabilities of a particular library or framework? 

6. Is this sample relevant and up-to-date with current best practices and technology trends?  

7. Does the sample demonstrate a complete and realistic scenario, showcase a real-world use case or scenario?
    * Avoid overly simplistic or contrived examples.
    * Avoid abstract examples; provide context. 

## Practical implementation:  

1. What are the specific technologies that will be used? What are their licences?
    * specific framework
    * AI model
    * dataset 

2. What are the necessary steps for the developer to follow to perform the code sample successfully? 
    * Describe the intended workflow 
    & Describe sequence of operations that the code sample follows from input to output
    * what is the input?
    * what is the output?
